# Marriage And Divorce Database
Today in the 21st-century marriage is no longer just recognise as opposite genders as some countries have changed their law to allow for same-sex marriages as did the Netherlands back in 2001 and was one of the first to allow for this change, in addition, a further 63 countries have followed their suit including Ireland. Ireland has seen great changes in the marriages ceremonies from a religious ceremony to civil ceremony as to the relation of the mix of foreign national religion beliefs and an option of Irish civil marriage ceremonies venues (Hotels, Parks, etc.). As each day two parties marry, divorce, or remarry in Ireland or one of 195 countries in the world, with each having their own law of how these parties can marry could give the process of designing a database for marriage and divorce a complex task.
